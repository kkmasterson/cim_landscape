  - Pull request workflow with required reviews

### Task Management
- **GitHub Issues**: Task tracking and assignment
  - Labels:
    - `component`: Component-related tasks
    - `page`: Page-related tasks
    - `bug`: Issue fixes
    - `enhancement`: New features
    - `documentation`: Documentation tasks
    - Priority labels: `high`, `medium`, `low`
