## Key Planning Decisions

1. **Eight Primary Pages**:
   - Home
   - About
   - Core Features
   - Technology Stack
   - Interactive Demos
   - Blog/Insights
   - Community Hub
   - Contact/Support

2. **Three Core Technical Features**:
   - Graph visualization engine supporting multiple formats
   - SVG animation system for interactive illustrations
   - Theme switching between light and dark modes

3. **Five-Phase Implementation**:
   - Phase 1: Foundation (project setup, core layout)
   - Phase 2: Core Components (UI library, theme system)
   - Phase 3: Visualization Engine (graph system, animations)
   - Phase 4: Integration & Content (page assembly, content)
   - Phase 5: Optimization & Launch (performance, deployment)

4. **Key Technical Approaches**:
   - Leptos for reactive UI components
   - Rust/WebAssembly for high-performance visualizations
   - TailwindCSS for styling following the style guide
   - Component-based architecture for maintainability
   - SVG-based visualizations for performance and quality

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Planning Phase**:
   - Review and finalize all planning documents
   - Secure stakeholder approval
   - Prioritize implementation tasks

2. **Transition to Creative Phase**:
   - Develop detailed component design specifications
   - Create design system based on style guide
   - Define animation patterns and interaction models
   - Establish visual language for graph visualizations

3. **Prepare for Implementation**:
   - Set up development environment
   - Initialize GitHub repository
   - Configure build system
   - Create project structure

## Plan Approval
This plan requires approval before proceeding to the Creative phase. The Creative phase will focus on detailed design decisions and visual/interaction specifications based on this plan.
