## Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Dependencies
1. Design system finalization before component development
2. Core UI components before page implementation
3. Visualization framework before interactive demos
4. Content preparation before content integration
5. Quality assurance before deployment

### Risk Management
- Early prototyping of visualization components to identify technical challenges
- Phased approach to allow for iteration and refinement
- Regular progress reviews and adjustment of timeline if needed
- Prioritization of core features to ensure MVP delivery
